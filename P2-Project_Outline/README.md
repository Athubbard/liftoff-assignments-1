# Project Outline


### Overview
The Church Everywhere app will allow user to find churches of their preference or denomination based on the current
gps location of user. Users will login and set preferences of the kind of churches they want to visit in other states.
When a user is logged in churches will pop up on google maps with churches that fit user's preferance only.

This idea came from the desire to attend church services and events even if out of town.

### Features

- User Login: Users would be able to login by creating an account. All access will be restricted to logged in users.
- Set preferences: Users can set church denomination preferences.
- Search churches: Users can find churches in any city and state.
- Manage: Users can view and manage churches attended before.
- Google maps integration.
- Delete churches: users will be able to delete churches they have visited or added to preferences.

### Technologies

C#
MySQL
Bootstrap or Jquery


### What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn how to use API's in order to incorporate google maps integration.
I will need to learn to use test-driven development
